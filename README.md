# CPSC-323-FINAL-PROJECT
The syntactical analyzer will be implemented either with C++ or python.

Edit from the future: its definitely python :)

Aatib Abdullah is collaborator, no mistake about it.


The FINAL_VERSION branch has the final product, it fails to detect if ',' commas are missing.
